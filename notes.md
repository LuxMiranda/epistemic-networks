Note:
We find that, in a very small number of samples, stable polarizations occur with A agents with credences 0.01 < credence < 0.5. 
We suspect W&O2021 may not have encountered this due to their much smaller sample sizes. 
Thus, we add a criteria that the polarization is stable if credence < 0.1 OR if the simulation continues for X number of steps in the polarized state



Recommend based on evidence
^ more realistic than recommending based on belief, since evidence is directly accessible (while beliefs can only be inferred)


What is the best case scenario?
